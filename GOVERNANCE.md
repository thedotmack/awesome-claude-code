# Governance Model

## Overview

This repository is governed by a **multi-maintainer model** with transparent decision-making processes. Our goal is to serve the Claude Code community by providing open, inclusive access to quality resources.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Transparency** — All decisions are made publicly
2. **Inclusivity** — Everyone can contribute
3. **Objectivity** — Decisions based on clear criteria, not opinions
4. **Community-First** — Serve users and contributors above all

---

## Maintainers

### Current Maintainers

- [@thedotmack](https://github.com/thedotmack) — Founder & Lead Maintainer

### Becoming a Maintainer

Maintainers are elected based on:
- **Consistent contributions** to the repository
- **Community engagement** and support
- **Alignment with project values**
- **Technical competence** with the tools and workflows

To nominate yourself or someone else, open an issue with the `maintainer-nomination` label.

---

## Decision-Making

### Automated Decisions (No Vote Needed)

**Resource Submissions:**
- If validation passes → **Automatically approved**
- No human decision required
- Maintainers can remove clear spam/malware after auto-approval

**Documentation Updates:**
- Typo fixes, clarifications → Merge on approval
- Minor improvements → Merge on approval

### Maintainer Voting

Decisions requiring votes need **2/3 majority** of active maintainers:

1. **Validation Criteria Changes**
   - Adding/removing validation rules
   - Changing thresholds or requirements

2. **Policy Changes**
   - Governance model changes
   - Code of conduct updates
   - Major philosophical shifts

3. **Maintainer Actions**
   - Adding new maintainers (2/3 vote)
   - Removing maintainers (2/3 vote, affected party abstains)
   - Handling serious Code of Conduct violations

### Community Input

For major changes, we use a **RFC (Request for Comments)** process:
1. Open an issue with `rfc` label
2. Allow 7 days for community feedback
3. Maintainers vote after considering feedback
4. Announce decision and rationale

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Lead Maintainer

- **Tie-breaking vote** in 1/3 splits
- **Coordination** of maintainer team

- **Monitor** for spam and malicious submissions
- **Support** community members

## What Maintainers CANNOT Do

To prevent gatekeeping, maintainers **explicitly cannot**:

❌ **Reject validated submissions** based on personal opinion  
❌ **Add subjective criteria** to validation without RFC + community approval  
❌ **Block submissions** for category, style, or popularity reasons  
❌ **Require donations** or link funding to inclusion  
❌ **Make unilateral major changes** without vote/RFC

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Disagreements Among Maintainers

1. **Discussion** — Try to reach consensus
2. **Voting** — If no consensus, vote (2/3 majority)
3. **RFC** — If contentious, open RFC for community input
4. **Lead tie-break** — Lead maintainer breaks ties if needed

### Contributor Conflicts

1. **Code of Conduct** — All interactions must be respectful
2. **Mediation** — Maintainers mediate disputes
3. **Escalation** — Serious violations → maintainer team decision
4. **Ban** — Only for repeated, serious CoC violations (2/3 vote)

### Resource Disputes

If someone claims a resource is:
- **Malware/spam** → Maintainers can remove immediately, open issue to discuss
- **Copyright violation** → Remove immediately upon DMCA notice
- **Low quality** → Community decides through usage; do not remove
- **Duplicate** → Keep both if they serve different purposes

---

## Transparency

### Public Records

All maintained publicly in this repository:
- **Maintainer list** (this file)
- **Decision logs** (via GitHub issues/PRs)
- **Voting records** (in issue comments)
- **RFC outcomes** (in RFC issues)

### Private Discussions

Limited to:

- **Personal disputes** (respect privacy)
- **Legal issues** (DMCA, etc.)

Once resolved, outcome is made public (without private details).

---

## Funding and Sponsorship

### Funding Model

- **Optional donations** welcome but not required
- **Complete separation** between funding and curation
- **Transparent usage** — All donations/expenses documented publicly
- **No influence** — Donors get no special inclusion privileges

### Sponsorships

- **Project/infrastructure sponsorships** welcome (e.g., CI credits)
- **Tool sponsorships** do **NOT** influence inclusion
- All sponsorships disclosed publicly
