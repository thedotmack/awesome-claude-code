# Template: Locked Thread (Issue #228)

Special template for @schlunsen whose thread was locked as "too heated" after expressing frustration and being asked to donate.

---

## Message Template

**⚠️ Use with extra care and empathy**

```markdown
Hi @schlunsen,

I came across your submission for **Claude Control Terminal** (hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code#228) and was troubled by what happened. Your tool clearly has value - it's a comprehensive, high-performance solution with impressive specs.

What happened wasn't right. Nobody should be asked to donate as part of a submission review, and expressing frustration about delays shouldn't result in a locked thread.

## I Built an Alternative

I've forked awesome-claude-code specifically to address these issues:
- **No pay-to-play** — Donations never influence inclusion decisions
- **No gatekeeping** — Validation passes = automatically approved
- **Respectful community** — Frustration about delays is understandable

Your tool deserves better treatment. See the full analysis of upstream issues: https://github.com/thedotmack/awesome-claude-code/blob/main/GATEKEEPING_ANALYSIS.md

## Our Philosophy

- **🎯 Validation = Approval** — If validation passes, you're automatically listed
- **⚡ Zero-Wait** — Target < 1 hour approval time
- **🚫 No Pay-to-Play** — Complete separation of funding and curation
- **🤝 Respectful Community** — We understand developer frustration

## Would You Like to Submit Here?

Claude Control Terminal would be a great addition to our list. The process is simple:
1. Open an issue using our submission template: https://github.com/thedotmack/awesome-claude-code/issues/new/choose
2. Fill in the information about your tool (or copy from your original submission)
3. Our automated validation runs
4. **If validation passes → You're automatically approved!** 🎉

No donation requests. No locked threads. No judgment for expressing frustration.

## What We're Building

A community where:
- Quality tools get immediate visibility
- Maintainers are respectful and transparent
- Donations are optional and don't influence curation
- Developers are valued contributors, not fundraising targets

P.S. Your apology in the thread showed real character. But you had nothing to apologize for - your frustration was justified.
```

## Customization Guide

- **{YOUR_NAME}** - Your name or maintainer team name

---

## Special Considerations

1. **Extra Empathy** - This developer was treated particularly poorly
2. **Acknowledge Injustice** - Be clear about what was wrong
3. **No Pressure** - Make it 100% their choice
4. **Respectful Tone** - Don't bash the upstream maintainer, just state facts
5. **Validate Their Feelings** - Their frustration was justified

---

## Why This Case Matters

Issue #228 represents one of the most egregious examples of gatekeeping:
1. Developer built comprehensive tool with impressive specs
2. Got frustrated waiting for review
3. Used strong language in frustration
4. Apologized sincerely for the language
5. **Maintainer responded by asking for donation to fundraising campaign**
6. Accused developer of fabricating GitHub stats
7. **Thread was locked as "too heated"**

This is pay-to-play behavior and it's unacceptable. This case is explicitly mentioned in our analysis as evidence of the systemic problems.

---

## Tone Guidelines

- **Do**: Be empathetic, acknowledge injustice, offer alternative
- **Don't**: Be aggressive, insult maintainer, pressure developer
- **Do**: Validate their frustration as justified
- **Don't**: Encourage more conflict or drama

---

## If They Respond Negatively

Some possibilities:
- They might not want to engage with awesome-lists anymore
- They might feel uncomfortable with public discussion of the issue
- They might want to move on from the incident

**Respect their choice.** Our goal is to offer an alternative, not to relitigate past conflicts.
