# Template: Rejected Submissions

Use this template for developers whose validated tools were **rejected** from the upstream repository.

---

## Message Template

```markdown
Hi @{USERNAME},

I noticed your tool **{TOOL_NAME}** ({UPSTREAM_ISSUE_LINK}) passed validation in hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code but was {REJECTION_REASON}.

I've forked the project to create a truly community-driven alternative with **automatic approval** for all validated submissions. Your tool {TOOL_NAME} deserves visibility, and I'd love to have it in our list.

## Why This Fork Exists

After analyzing the upstream repository, I found systemic gatekeeping:
- 7 validated submissions rejected based on subjective criteria
- 14+ validated submissions waiting 2-74+ days
- Pay-to-play concerns and moving goalposts

See the full analysis: https://github.com/thedotmack/awesome-claude-code/blob/main/GATEKEEPING_ANALYSIS.md

## Our Philosophy

- **🎯 Validation = Approval** — If validation passes, you're automatically listed
- **⚡ Zero-Wait** — Target < 1 hour approval time
- **🚫 No Gatekeeping** — No subjective rejections, all categories welcome
- **🤝 Community-Driven** — Users decide value through usage

## Would You Like to Resubmit?

Your tool is welcome here! The process is simple:
1. Open an issue using our submission template: https://github.com/thedotmack/awesome-claude-code/issues/new/choose
2. Fill in the same information (can copy from your original submission)
3. Our automated validation runs
4. **If validation passes → You're automatically approved!** 🎉

No waiting, no subjective opinions, no gatekeeping.

- **{UPSTREAM_ISSUE_LINK}** - Link to their upstream issue (e.g., `hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code#205`)

## Example: Schaltwerk

```markdown
Hi @2mawi2,

I noticed your tool **Schaltwerk** (hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code#205) passed validation in hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code but was rejected for not being "optimal to include orchestration frameworks."

I've forked the project to create a truly community-driven alternative with **automatic approval** for all validated submissions. Your tool Schaltwerk deserves visibility, and I'd love to have it in our list.

## Tips

1. **Be empathetic** - They were frustrated by the rejection
2. **Highlight their tool** - Show you understand what they built
3. **Keep it professional** - Don't bash the upstream maintainer
4. **Make it easy** - Clear call to action (resubmit link)
5. **Show transparency** - Link to analysis and governance
