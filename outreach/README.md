Contact developers #6-10 (rejected tools)

### Phase 3: Medium Priority (Week 3)
Contact developers #11-19 (waiting tools)

### Timing
- Send messages 1-2 days apart
- Don't overwhelm the community
- Allow time for response before next batch

## Communication Channels

### Primary: GitHub Issue Comments
Post a comment on their original issue in the upstream repository

### Alternative: GitHub Discussions
If they're active in discussions, can reach out there

### Do NOT:
- Send unsolicited direct messages
- Spam multiple channels
- Make promises we can't keep

## Tracking

Keep track of outreach in a spreadsheet or issue:
- [ ] Developer contacted

- [ ] Submission auto-approved
