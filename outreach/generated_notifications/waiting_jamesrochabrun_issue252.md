Hi @jamesrochabrun,

I noticed your tool **Claw Code** (https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/issues/252) has been waiting **4+ days** for approval in hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code, even though it passed validation.

**Your tool has now been added to a community-driven fork!**

🎉 **Your tool is now listed at:** https://github.com/thedotmack/awesome-claude-code

## The Waiting Problem

After analyzing the upstream repository, I found:
- Your submission is one of **14+ validated tools waiting** for approval
- Some submissions have been waiting **74+ days**
- Your tool passed validation but has been waiting **4+ days**

This isn't right. Quality tools deserve immediate visibility.

## Our Philosophy

- **🎯 Validation = Approval** — If validation passes, you're automatically listed
- **⚡ Zero-Wait** — Target < 1 hour approval time (not weeks!)
- **🚫 No Indefinite Queues** — No more waiting in limbo
- **🤝 Community-Driven** — Users decide value through usage

## Your Tool's New Home

✅ Your tool has been added to: https://github.com/thedotmack/awesome-claude-code/blob/main/README.md

Search for "Claw Code" to see your listing with:

## What This Means

- **Immediate Visibility**: No more waiting - your tool is live now

## You Can Keep Both Submissions

This is not an "either/or" situation:
- Keep your upstream submission if you'd like (maybe they'll eventually approve it)
- Your tool is already live here through auto-approval
- Reach users who are looking for the community-driven alternative
