# Template: Waiting Submissions

Use this template for developers whose validated tools are **still waiting** for approval in the upstream repository.

---

## Message Template

```markdown
Hi @{USERNAME},

I noticed your tool **{TOOL_NAME}** ({UPSTREAM_ISSUE_LINK}) has been waiting {DAYS_WAITING} days for approval in hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code, even though it passed validation on {DATE_VALIDATED}.

I've forked the project to create a truly community-driven alternative with **automatic approval** for all validated submissions. You shouldn't have to wait any longer!

## The Waiting Problem

After analyzing the upstream repository, I found:
- Your submission is one of **14+ validated tools waiting** for approval
- Some submissions have been waiting **74+ days**
- Even submissions assigned to the maintainer aren't getting approved

This isn't right. Quality tools deserve immediate visibility.

See the full analysis: https://github.com/thedotmack/awesome-claude-code/blob/main/GATEKEEPING_ANALYSIS.md

## Our Philosophy

- **🎯 Validation = Approval** — If validation passes, you're automatically listed
- **⚡ Zero-Wait** — Target < 1 hour approval time (not weeks!)
- **🚫 No Indefinite Queues** — No more waiting in limbo
- **🤝 Community-Driven** — Users decide value through usage

## Want Immediate Approval?

Your tool can be listed today! The process is simple:
1. Open an issue using our submission template: https://github.com/thedotmack/awesome-claude-code/issues/new/choose
2. Fill in the same information (can copy from your original submission)
3. Our automated validation runs
4. **If validation passes → You're automatically approved within the hour!** 🎉

No more waiting, no gatekeeping, just instant inclusion.

## You Can Keep Your Upstream Submission Too

This is not an "either/or" situation:
- Keep your upstream submission if you'd like (maybe they'll eventually approve it)
- Get immediate visibility here through auto-approval
- Reach users who are looking for the community-driven alternative

## The Waiting Problem

After analyzing the upstream repository, I found:
- Your submission is one of **14+ validated tools waiting** for approval
- Some submissions have been waiting **74+ days** (yours is the longest!)
- Even submissions assigned to the maintainer aren't getting approved

This isn't right. Quality tools deserve immediate visibility.

## Tips

1. **Emphasize the wait time** - Show you understand their frustration
2. **Offer immediate solution** - Make it clear they can get approved today
3. **Not either/or** - They can submit to both repositories
4. **Validate their tool** - Remind them validation passed (so it's quality)
5. **Call out specific issues** - If they're the longest wait, mention it
