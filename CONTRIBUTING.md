# Contributing to Awesome Claude Code

Welcome! We're excited that you want to contribute to Awesome Claude Code. This guide will walk you through our streamlined contribution process.

**Important:** We take security seriously. All submissions are carefully reviewed to ensure they don't expose users to data risks or malicious code. Advanced tools may take additional time to review.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms. Follow the conventions of the repo and don't engage in self-promotion. Use descriptive language, not "marketing" style.

### The Submission Process

Here's what happens when you submit a resource:

    A[📝 Fill out submission form] --> B[🤖 Automated validation]
    B --> C{Valid?}
    C -->|❌ No| D[Bot comments with issues]
    D --> E[Edit your submission]
    E --> B
    C -->|✅ Yes| F[Awaits maintainer review]
    F --> G{Decision}
    G -->|👍 Approved| H[Bot creates PR automatically]
    G -->|🔄 Changes requested| I[Maintainer requests changes]
    G -->|👎 Rejected| J[Issue closed with reason]
    I --> E
    H --> K[PR merged]
    K --> L[🎉 Resource goes live!]
    L --> M[You receive notification]
```

### What We Validate

When you submit a resource, our bot checks:

- ✅ All required fields are filled
- ✅ URLs are valid and accessible
- ✅ No duplicate resources exist
- ✅ License information (when available)
- ✅ Description length and quality

**NOTE:** By submitting a resource, you agree to allowing your codebase to be evaluated by a SoTA LLM for any security risks.

### If Changes Are Needed

Don't worry if validation fails! The bot will:

1. Post a clear comment explaining what needs to be fixed
2. Update the issue labels to reflect the status
3. Re-validate automatically when you edit your submission

Simply edit your issue to fix any problems - no need to create a new submission.

### Approval Process

Once validation passes:

1. A maintainer will review your submission for quality and relevance
2. They may:
   - ✅ **Approve** - Type `/approve` and the bot creates a PR
   - 🔄 **Request changes** - Type `/request-changes` with feedback
   - ❌ **Reject** - Type `/reject` with reason

### After Approval

The magic happens automatically:

1. Bot creates a fresh branch from latest main (no merge conflicts!)
2. Adds your resource to the CSV
3. Regenerates the README
4. Creates a pull request
5. Links everything back to your issue
6. Closes your submission issue

You'll be notified at every step, and if your resource is on GitHub, you'll receive a special notification issue in your repository! 🎉

- Include complete uninstall/cleanup instructions
- Please mention if any core Claude Code system files are touched or managed by this resource.
- The more decoupled/indepedent your resource is from other resources or core Claude Code functionality, the easier it is for me to test, and for others to try out and adopt, and integrate with their workflow.
- Include an attribution to Anthropic, the company that built Claude Code and owns the license/trademark.
