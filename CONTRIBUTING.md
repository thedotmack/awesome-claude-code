# Contributing to Awesome Claude Code

Welcome! We're excited that you want to contribute to Awesome Claude Code. This guide will walk you through our streamlined contribution process.

**Important:** We take security seriously. All submissions are carefully reviewed to ensure they don't expose users to data risks or malicious code. Advanced tools may take additional time to review.

## Everyone Gets to Play üéâ

This is a truly community-driven awesome list. If your submission passes validation, it gets added automatically. No gatekeeping, no waiting.

### Validation = Inclusion

When your submission:
- ‚úÖ Has working links
- ‚úÖ Follows proper format
- ‚úÖ Isn't spam or malicious
- ‚úÖ Provides genuine value

**It automatically goes live.** No manual approval needed.

### Quality Guidelines (Objective Only)

- Working URLs that are publicly accessible
- Clear, descriptive (not marketing) language
- Proper license information
- No duplicate submissions
- Respects Claude Code Terms of Service

That's it. No subjective barriers.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms. Follow the conventions of the repo and don't engage in self-promotion. Use descriptive language, not "marketing" style.

## How to Submit a Resource

### üöÄ **[Click here to submit a new resource](https://github.com/thedotmack/awesome-claude-code/issues/new?template=submit-resource.yml)**

That's it! Just click the link above and fill out the form. No Git knowledge required.

### The Submission Process

Here's what happens when you submit a resource:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[üìù Fill out submission form] --> B[ü§ñ Automated validation]
    B --> C{Valid?}
    C -->|‚ùå No| D[Bot comments with issues]
    D --> E[Edit your submission]
    E --> B
    C -->|‚úÖ Yes| F[ü§ñ Bot automatically creates PR]
    F --> G[PR merged]
    G --> H[üéâ Resource goes live!]
    H --> I[You receive notification]
```

### What We Validate

When you submit a resource, our bot checks:

- ‚úÖ All required fields are filled
- ‚úÖ URLs are valid and accessible
- ‚úÖ No duplicate resources exist
- ‚úÖ License information (when available)
- ‚úÖ Description length and quality

**NOTE:** By submitting a resource, you agree to allowing your codebase to be evaluated by a SoTA LLM for any security risks.

### If Changes Are Needed

Don't worry if validation fails! The bot will:

1. Post a clear comment explaining what needs to be fixed
2. Update the issue labels to reflect the status
3. Re-validate automatically when you edit your submission

Simply edit your issue to fix any problems - no need to create a new submission.

### After Validation Passes

The magic happens automatically:

1. Bot creates a fresh branch from latest main (no merge conflicts!)
2. Adds your resource to the CSV
3. Regenerates the README
4. Creates a pull request
5. Links everything back to your issue
6. Closes your submission issue

You'll be notified at every step, and if your resource is on GitHub, you'll receive a special notification issue in your repository! üéâ

- The more decoupled/indepedent your resource is from other resources or core Claude Code functionality, the easier it is for me to test, and for others to try out and adopt, and integrate with their workflow.
- Include an attribution to Anthropic, the company that built Claude Code and owns the license/trademark.
