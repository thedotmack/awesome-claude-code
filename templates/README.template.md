## üöÄ About This Fork: An Open Alternative

> **Everyone gets to play.**

This is a **community-driven fork** that implements **automatic approval** for all validated submissions. No gatekeeping, no waiting, no subjective rejections.

### Why This Fork Exists

After [extensive analysis](./GATEKEEPING_ANALYSIS.md), we identified systemic gatekeeping in the upstream repository: 7 validated submissions rejected based on subjective criteria, 14+ waiting 2-74+ days, and pay-to-play concerns.

### Our Philosophy

- **üéØ Validation = Approval** ‚Äî If validation passes, you're automatically listed
- **‚ö° Zero-Wait** ‚Äî Target < 1 hour approval time
- **ü§ù Community-Driven** ‚Äî Users decide value, not maintainer opinion
- **üö´ No Pay-to-Play** ‚Äî Donations never influence inclusion
- **üìÇ All Categories Welcome** ‚Äî No discrimination against tools types
- **üìã Stable Requirements** ‚Äî No moving goalposts
