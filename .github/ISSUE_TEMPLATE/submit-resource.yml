        ## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

        Thank you for submitting a resource to Awesome Claude Code! This form will guide you through the submission process.

        **Submission Guidelines:**
        - Submit only ONE resource per issue
        - Ensure your resource provides genuine value to Claude Code users
        - All links must be publicly accessible
        - Check that your resource hasn't already been submitted
        - Avoid submitting resources that violate the Claude Code Usage Policy (to the best of your understanding)

        **Other Important Guidelines:**
        - Submissions will be closely scrutinized for security and potential risk.
        - Please provide clear installation AND uninstallation instructions for any installable resources.
        - Short examples or demos are tremendously helpful in the review process.
        - If your resource requires "--dangerously-skip-permissions", please make sure the user is aware of this(!)

        After submission, our automated system will validate your resource and post the results as a comment.
