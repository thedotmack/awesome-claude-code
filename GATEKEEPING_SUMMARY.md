## 🎯 Quick Facts

### The Problem
| Metric | Count | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Validated & Rejected | 7 | Tools that passed validation but were subjectively rejected |
| Validated & Waiting | 14+ | Tools stuck in queue, some for 74+ days |
| Total Affected | 21+ | High-quality tools blocked from community |
| Longest Wait | 74+ days | #122 claude-code-guardian |
| Most Egregious | #228 | Developer asked for donation, thread locked as "too heated" |

### Our Solution
- ✅ **Validation passed = automatically listed**
- ⚡ **Zero-wait inclusion** (target: < 1 hour)
- 🤝 **Community-driven** decision making
- 🚫 **No pay-to-play** - donations never affect inclusion
- 📂 **All categories welcome** - no discrimination
- 📋 **Clear, stable requirements** - no moving goalposts

## 🔍 Gatekeeping Patterns Identified

### 1. Subjective Opinion Over Objective Quality
- Tools rejected for "design is overkill" or "not unique enough"
- Personal taste overrides validation results

### 2. Moving Goalposts
- Requirements change during review
- Developers iterate but face new objections
- Example: "Make it open source" → open sourced → "Wait longer" → months pass

### 3. Popularity-Based Approval
- Tools need star counts or "maturity" to be approved
- New projects can't get visibility because they need visibility first

### 4. Indefinite Waiting Periods
- 74+ days for some validated submissions
- No SLA or timeline commitments
- Even maintainer's own tools stuck waiting

### 5. Pay-to-Play Concerns
- Developer asked to donate to fundraising campaign
- Creates perception that donations influence approval
- Highly unethical gatekeeping

### 6. Category Discrimination
- Entire categories dismissed: "I don't want orchestrators"
- Blogs/handbooks rejected because "they become stale"
- Arbitrary exclusions regardless of quality
