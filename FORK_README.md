# About This Fork: An Open Alternative

> **🚀 Everyone gets to play.**

This is a community-driven fork of `hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code` that implements **automatic approval** for all validated submissions.

## Why This Fork Exists

After extensive analysis ([see full details](./GATEKEEPING_ANALYSIS.md)), we identified systemic gatekeeping in the upstream repository:
- **7 validated submissions rejected** based on subjective criteria
- **14+ validated submissions waiting** 2-74+ days for approval
- **Moving goalposts** that change requirements during review
- **Pay-to-play concerns** damaging community trust

## Our Philosophy

### 🎯 Validation = Approval
If your submission passes automated validation, it's **automatically listed**. No subjective opinions, no waiting, no gatekeeping.

### ⚡ Zero-Wait Inclusion
Target approval time: **< 1 hour** after validation passes. No indefinite queues.

### 🤝 Community-Driven
The community decides which tools are valuable through usage, stars, and recommendations - not a single maintainer's opinion.

### 🚫 No Pay-to-Play
Donations **never** factor into inclusion decisions. Funding and curation are completely separated.

### 📂 All Categories Welcome
Orchestrators, handbooks, cheat sheets, simple tools, beginner resources - all are valuable and welcome.

### 📋 Clear, Stable Requirements
Requirements don't change during review. No moving goalposts.

## What We Changed

| Upstream | This Fork |
|----------|-----------|
| Manual approval after validation | ✅ **Auto-approval** after validation |
| No timeline for approval | ⚡ **< 1 hour** target |
| Subjective quality judgments | 🎯 **Objective validation** only |
| Some categories disfavored | 📂 **All categories** welcome |
| Popularity requirements | 🆕 **New tools** equally valued |

## What We Kept

✅ **Robust validation system** - License checks, link validation, quality standards  
✅ **High standards** - Only quality tools that meet objective criteria  
✅ **GitHub-based workflow** - Same submission process  
✅ **Community moderation** - Spam/malware can still be removed

## For Users

### Why Use This Fork?

- **More tools available** - Includes quality tools rejected upstream
- **Faster updates** - No manual approval bottleneck
- **Complete visibility** - All validated tools get equal treatment

**Quality is maintained through validation, not gatekeeping.**

Every tool must still:

## FAQ

**Q: Won't this result in low-quality tools?**  
A: No. Validation ensures quality. We're removing subjective gatekeeping that happens *after* validation passes.

**Q: What about spam?**  
A: Validation catches most spam. Maintainers can still remove clear spam/malware. We're not removing moderation - just subjective gatekeeping.

**Q: Why not just fix upstream?**  
A: The patterns documented in our analysis show systemic issues requiring fundamental philosophy changes. A fork demonstrates the alternative approach.

**Q: What if upstream adopts these practices?**  
A: We'd celebrate! Our goal is open access, not competition. We'd happily collaborate or merge back.
